          <h3>Girls Who Code Summer Intensive Program</h3>
          <p>Here I learned to use languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create website. With new found tool, I created a website centered around climate change; raising awareness to the issue.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Kode With Klossy Mobile App Dev</h3>
          <p>This is my first time participating in as a Kode with Klossy Computer Science Scholar. Through this camp, I learned how to use Swift, and the iteration cycles required to create an app.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>In-School IB SL Computer Science</h3>
          <p>My high school offered computer sciences courses that only junior grade students could participate in. In my junior year I decided I wanted to pursue computer science further and through the course I learned more than just software development. A majority of the course focused on computer systems, parts, etcs. We also learned python through the lense of a backend developer.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Attending College For Computer Science</h3>
          <p>Enjoying most of what I learned about computer science, I decided to make it my future career. Even though this was my major I couldn't take any computer science classes.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Transferring Colleges Deciding to Change Majors</h3>
          <p>After my first semester, I ultimately decided that I enjoyed math and problem solving more than computer science. This also led to my choice of transferring to the University of Michigan; I wanted to try something new even if I wasn't entirely sure of it.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Kode With Klossy x Black Wealth Data Center Challenge</h3>
          <p>Despite my decision to change majors; computer science is still incredabily enjoyable to me, which was why I decided to participate in this program. Although it's been a long time since I have coded, this programmed called to my programming heart.</p>
